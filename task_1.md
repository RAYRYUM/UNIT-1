Question 1: Do you think it is necessary to involve the show owner during the process along the three weeks? 
Or alternatively, is it better to involve him only when the product is finished? Explain your answer

I think it is crucial to involve the client in the development of the product, especially in the creation of 
a project such as ours. This not only reassures the client about the functionality and implementation of the 
main criterias that were originally given at the start of the development, but it also allows for further i
nsight of what could be improved and/or could be implemented into the product.


Question 2: Do you think it is necessary to create MVPs for your game? If so, what would some of the MPV look 
like and what do you expect to obtain from the client?

I think it would be necessary to create MVPs for the client for our game project. I believe these MVPs do not 
have to be a full-fledged chapter of the game or anything that might resemble the game itself when it is finalized. 
It should rather be small parts of the game that show off the game’s functionality, therefore everything that involves 
the coding behind it, rather than what the final project may end up looking like. From this, the client can determine 
if that certain functionality needs more development or fixing. The main function of delivering such MVPs to clients 
is to gain more knowledge of what is required for the project from the client’s side.


Question 3: Do you see similarities between the Human-Centered Design cycle presented in the video and the Design Cycle 
we use for developing software? Explain.

The similarities between our design cycle and the human-centered design cycle shown in the video are seen the most in 
the aspect of evaluation and implementation. These two aspects heavily involve feedback from the client, which comes 
together as a learning process in order to further improve the project in order to meet the needs given by the client. 


Question 4: What are the simple principles for human-centered design presented in the video? Write a sentence with 
the definition of each.

The four main principles for human-centered design is ; 

Idea generation ; Idea generation is described as the process of creating, developing and communicating abstract, 
concrete or visual ideas. This is the first step that comes into play when developing a product.

Prototyping ; A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. 
This testing also tests it’s functionality.

Testing ; The trial of the quality of something: to put to the test. a particular process or method for trying or assessing.
This also tests it’s functionality..

Observation ; Observation is a method of data collection in which. researchers observe within a specific research field. 
This helps assess what needs further improvement.

Question 5. Consider your game. Think about ways you can improve the Players’ Experience using Human-centered design. 
Write below your ideas:

I believe that having multiple prototypes tested by various potential players and observing their main points of feedback 
is an extremely crucial part of detecting the flaws and strong points of the game. For example, there may be elements of 
the game that may seem well constructed from the coder’s point of view, but is actually very confusing to manipulate from 
the player’s pov.
