**STOP** _THINK_ WRITE

q1. 

The planning involves choosing the format of the game as well as the main subject of it ; this includes the processor it will run on,
as well as how it will be accesible.
From this, you will be able to plan out in game story. lines and maps,
as well as the limits it holds in term of player interactivity. This includes how the player will actually play the game, as well as how the game code itself will
be formatted and in what way it is ordered.

The three main points of planning is ;
planning
testing
implementation

q2.

The success criteria is there in order to create a base for measurement of evaluation of the project. Without this base measurement of the success of the game cannot be measured. In addition to this, it allows the coder to have base elements to look after and actively test in order to make sure they are well implemented in the code itself.

q3. 

After the completion of this unit i have come to learn that coding has an infinite amount of possibilities, as well as the many components that come with whilst coding. One of the main things i have learnt the most through this game project was involving the class list system. 
In addition to this i have learnt that coding is extremely collaborative and working with other coders and research can be very beneficial.
I understahnd now that computers work on the base of "_if_" statements.

q4.

I have learnt that it is easier for me to have the answers to a question and then try and understand why that answer is given, rather than to go through the endless trouble of finding it.
in addition to this, i have learnt further that i am a very visual planner and learner, therefore when there is code that i do not understand the concept of or that i did not plan out before writing it, i found it very hard to get a grasp of it after having moved on to another piece. 

q5.

I believe that learning new concepts have worked well for me and gave me alot of benefits whilst writing my code.
In addition to this, planning out the game it self with its many aspects and elements that were implemented story-wise was very fun for me to create and imagine, as well as to create visual art for it. From this i have learnt alot about the existance of ascii art, which is text art.

q6. 

One thing that definetly did not benefit me in the long run is the amount of code i had taken from online resources. Although this did help me alot in the creation and internal building of the code, i implemented on many occasions code that i did not understand in it's concept. 

q8.

i believe that the developper's responsability of their code goes up to the point of the success criteria and needs of their customer. The developper's job is to deliver a product that is based off a need of a customer.
